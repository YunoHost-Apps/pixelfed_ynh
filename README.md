## Overview

PixelFed is a decentralized and federated image sharing software under development.
In addition to taking over the functionality of Instagram, the functioning of PixelFed is:

* Decentralized: Each instance can follow one or more other PixelFed instances in order to allow their respective members to interact. A first pixelfed.social public body limited to 10,000 members has already been created.

* Federated: Via the ActivityPub protocol, PixelFed can interact with other software that is part of the Fediverse, such as Mastodon or PeerTube for example.

It is possible to import your data from Instagram.


**Shipped version:** 0.12.5~ynh1
