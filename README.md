## Overview

PixelFed is a decentralized and federated image sharing software under development.
In addition to taking over the functionality of Instagram, the functioning of PixelFed is:

* Decentralized: Each instance can follow one or more other PixelFed instances in order to allow their respective members to interact. A first pixelfed.social public body limited to 10,000 members has already been created.

* Federated: Via the ActivityPub protocol, PixelFed can interact with other software that is part of the Fediverse, such as Mastodon or PeerTube for example.

It is also possible to import your data from Instagram. 

**Shipped version:** 0.11.1~ynh1

## Disclaimers / important information

## Important points to read before installing

1. **Pixelfed** require a dedicated **root domain**, eg. pixelfed.domain.tld

### Administrator

After being first registered, you need to execute the folloing command to promote first registered as admin

**Run:**

    $ (cd /var/www/pixelfed && php7.3 artisan user:admin 1)

and respond yes to the question ` Add admin privileges to this user?`

### Allow/Close registrations

Registrations are open by default.
To change that setting, edit `/var/www/pixelfed/.env` and set `OPEN_REGISTRATION=false` instead of `true`.
Then run `php7.3 artisan config:cache` to reload the settings.

### Disable search engine indexing

If you don't want your Pixelfed instance to be indexed in search engine (and so on), edit `/var/www/pixelfed/public/robots.txt` like this:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```
Note: search engines will see that file and may or may not respect its content.

Since 0.10.10, by default `/discover/places/`, `/stories/` and `/i/` are present in that file.
